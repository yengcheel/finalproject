# Game Development Final Project 


This is a repository for my Game Development class final project.

## Game Name: Work in Progress
### Background:
###### Developed using Unity
Currently, I only really play a handful of games so what gets produced at the end of the term is a culmination of what i've experienced or seen. The only games I play nowadays during my free time are:
- Monster Hunter Rise + World(retired) - Everyday
- Phasmophobia(with friends only)
- Minecraft(with friends only)
- Others that I classify as "just to kill time with"

Not a very compelling list I know, but I have another hobby I pour my time into so playing other games or investing in a better PC aren't priorities for me.


For this game, I am aiming to capture a fight from one of the endgame boss fights for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, Alatreon and Fatalis. During the end of support cycle for the game, I would play MHW everyday and fight one or another or a few of the end game fights for that game out of boredom, reaching over 100 kills per monster(fatalis around 200 kills).

I want to also make it a 2d scroller/metroidvania type game as I also grew up loving the old Metroid titles like Super metroid, Fusion and Zero Mission. 

I am hoping for the end product to be a challenging but fun experience I faced in the Monster Hunter titles but in 2d pixel metroidvania fashion.
