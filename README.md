# Game Development Final Project 


This is a repository for my Game Development class final project.

As of 11/29/2022 this game is good enough to present

## Game Name: Probably wont come up with one anytime soon
### Background:
###### Developed using Unity
For this game, I am aiming to capture a fight from one of the endgame boss fights for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, Alatreon and Fatalis. During the end of support cycle for the game, I would play MHW everyday and fight one or another or a few of the end game fights for that game out of boredom, reaching over 100 kills per monster(fatalis around 200 kills).

I am hoping for the end product to be a challenging but fun experience I faced in the Monster Hunter titles but in 2d pixel theme.
